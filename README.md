### Hi üëã

I'm Anna, and I'm an anthropologist turned learning designer and CEO, turned front-end developer. In February 2021 I will have completed Technigo's Frontend Web Development Boot Camp (www.technigo.io), so I guess describing my professional me would be something like new (coding) skills meet senior work experience. ‚≠êÔ∏è

üíª I'm really enjoying every day of coding - it is challenging for sure to move into a new field but it is also so rewarding and exciting to get to learn new stuff all the time. With coding, a new world with never-ending possibilities to develop and learn is opening up. I get to create and I get to solve problems - I love it! ‚≠êÔ∏è

‚ö°Ô∏è Recent learning and fun fact: I took up horseback riding again some time ago and I've come to realize that riding a horse is not that different from coding - it is the same kind of feedback and reward system at work, I think. You know when you try, and try, and try to get something right - when you know what is supposed to happen in theory but doesn't happen in practice. That feeling of frustration. And then the other kind feeling when all of a sudden it works! That rush! I get both solving a coding problem and getting my horse to work with me. That makes all the hours in front of your screen or on your horse worth it. ‚≠êÔ∏è
