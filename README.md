### Hello 👋

I'm Anna, and I'm an anthropologist turned learning designer/CEO, turned front-end developer. In February 2021 I will have completed Technigo's Frontend Web Development Boot Camp (www.technigo.io), so I guess describing my professional me would be something like new (coding) skills meet senior work experience. ⭐️

💻  I'm really enjoying every day of coding - it is challenging for sure to move into a new field but it is also so rewarding and exciting to get to learn new stuff all the time. With coding, a new world with never-ending possibilities to develop and learn is opening up. I get to create and I get to solve problems - I love it! ⭐️
